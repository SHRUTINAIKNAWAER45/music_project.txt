Music Store Database Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes a music store database using SQL to understand customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends. The goal was to help the business identify top customers, best-selling artists, popular genres, and high-revenue regions to support better business decisions.

What I Did

I used SQL to:

Query and explore multiple tables including customers, invoices, tracks, artists, albums, and genres

Join tables to create meaningful business views

Apply aggregations, grouping, filtering, and sorting

Write subqueries and nested queries for deeper insights

Key Analysis Performed

Identified top-spending customers

Found best-selling artists and albums

Analyzed revenue by country and city

Determined most popular music genres

Evaluated sales trends and purchase behavior

Business Insights

From the SQL queries:

A small group of customers contributed a large share of total revenue

Certain genres and artists consistently generated higher sales

Specific regions showed stronger music demand than others

This helps the business to:

Target high-value customers

Promote top-selling artists and genres

Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue regions

Tools Used

SQL (Joins, Group By, Subqueries, Aggregate Functions)
